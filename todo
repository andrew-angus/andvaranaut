Neural net 
Dimensional reduction
Conrev functionality inherited from class in utils.py
NetCDF input and output
Sensitivity analysis
Adaptive sampler w. PyMC
Pandas data visualisation
Replace ray with dask
- integrate with pandas
- improve behaviour on sample failure
Option to save plots rather than display
GP predict on original data
Blank GP setup
Optionally set priors/xconrevs automatically with defaults
Set data labels which are then propagated through plots etc.
Proper docs ala scipy
More/better test cases (automatic suite?)
Multiple output support
Sparse regression for large datasets
Better evaluation of mean function after sampling
Fix fitting with restarts
