MCMC
Active subspaces
Conrev functionality inherited from class in utils.py
Input file handler
Folder cleanup
Sensitivity analysis
Cleanup adaptive sampler
Pandas data visualisation
Improved ray scheduling (In-code + sampling parallelism)
Better use underlying package functionality with **kwargs
Option to save plots rather than display
Delta ML integration
GP predict on original data
Blank GP setup
No printing option
Post-processing GP inputs (needs some random sampling of intensity/domain size then converted to LW energy flux at a point?)
Optionally set priors/xconrevs automatically within set_data
Silence error messages on mkdir run directory
Set data labels which are then propagated through plots etc.
Hessian calc finite difference order option
Proper docs ala scipy
More/better test cases (automatic suite?)
xopt updates to best result on multiple .opt() calls
Julia wrapper - parallelism, slow bits, plotting; do speed comparison with just running in python
